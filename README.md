# **QSCO-Project**

## **About Us**
- The **QSCO-Project**, established in **2015** and restructured in **2019**, is a cutting-edge organization focused on **OSINT (Open Source Intelligence)** with elements of **ASINT (Advanced Source Intelligence)**.

### **What is OSINT?**
- OSINT involves collecting and analyzing publicly available information to create actionable insights, from data analytics to strategic forecasting. However, **QSCO** takes this a step further by integrating **closed-source methods**, ensuring that sensitive information remains secure and proprietary.

- Our unique structure, known as **"The QS Process"**, is powered by five specialized departments, each contributing to securing and analyzing critical information. Additionally, QSCO employs its own **custom language, Mattricette**, to... partially... encode communications and maintain confidentiality.

---

### **What is Mattricette?**
- Mattricette is a custom language consisting of **159 words**, derived from English and translated into proprietary gibberish for secure communication.
